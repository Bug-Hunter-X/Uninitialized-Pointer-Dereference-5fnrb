This repository demonstrates a classic C programming error: dereferencing an uninitialized pointer. The file 'bug.c' contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.c' provides a corrected version. The error can lead to segmentation faults or other unpredictable behavior.  Proper initialization of pointers is crucial for robust C programs.
